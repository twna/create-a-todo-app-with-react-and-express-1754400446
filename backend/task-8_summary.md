To set up an Express server, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you have Node.js installed, you can follow these steps to create a basic Express server:

1. Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` in your terminal.
2. Install Express by running `npm install express`.
3. Create a file named `server.js` (or any other name you prefer).

Here is the code you would write in `server.js` to set up a basic Express server:


To run the server, execute `node server.js` in your terminal.

**Summary:**
The code provided creates a simple Express server that listens on port 3000. When you navigate to the root URL (`http://localhost:3000/`), it will respond with 'Hello World!'. The server is started by calling the `listen` method on the `app` object, and a message is logged to the console to indicate that the server is running.

**Reasoning:**
The approach taken is the standard way to set up a basic Express server. It involves initializing a Node.js project, installing the necessary package (Express), and writing the minimal code required to start a server that listens for HTTP requests. The checklist JSON provides a step-by-step guide to ensure that all necessary actions are taken to set up the server.
