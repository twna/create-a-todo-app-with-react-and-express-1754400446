Certainly! Below is an example of how you might create a route to handle fetching todos in a Node.js application using the Express framework. This example assumes you have a `Todo` model that interacts with your database to fetch the todo items.


**Summary:**

The code above defines an Express route handler for the HTTP GET request at the path `/todos`. When a GET request is made to this endpoint, the route handler attempts to fetch all todo items from the database using the `Todo.find()` method, which is assumed to be a part of a Mongoose model or similar ORM. If the operation is successful, it responds with the todos in JSON format. If there's an error, it responds with a 500 status code and an error message.

**Reasoning:**

The approach taken is standard for RESTful API design, using Express to create a simple and clean route. The use of `async/await` allows for readable asynchronous code, and error handling is included to ensure that the server can gracefully respond to any issues that might occur during the database operation. The JSON checklist provides a clear set of tasks that were accomplished in the code.
