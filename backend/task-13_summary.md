To set up a database connection for storing todos, you would typically use a database driver or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that is appropriate for your chosen database and programming language. Below is an example using Python with the SQLAlchemy ORM to connect to a SQLite database. This is a common choice for small applications or for prototyping.


**Summary:**

The code above does the following:

1. Imports necessary modules from SQLAlchemy.
2. Defines the database URI for a SQLite database.
3. Creates an engine that the ORM will use to connect to the database.
4. Defines a base class for declarative class definitions.
5. Creates a `Todo` class that inherits from the base class and represents the todos table in the database.
6. Defines the structure of the todos table with id, title, description, and completed columns.
7. Creates a sessionmaker that will be used to create sessions for interacting with the database.
8. Finally, it creates the tables in the database by calling `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`.

**Reasoning:**

SQLite is chosen for simplicity and ease of setup, as it does not require a separate database server. SQLAlchemy is a popular ORM that allows for database interactions using Python objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. This approach makes the code more maintainable and portable across different types of databases. The `Todo` model is defined with fields that are typical for a todo application, including an identifier, title, description, and a boolean to mark completion. The sessionmaker is used to handle transactions with the database, and the tables are created based on the model definitions.
