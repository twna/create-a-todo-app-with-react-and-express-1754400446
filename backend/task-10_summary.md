To create a route for adding a new todo, I'll assume we're using a web framework like Express.js for Node.js. Below is an example of how you might define this route in Express:


### Summary:
This code snippet defines a POST route at `/todos` which is used to add a new todo item. It uses an asynchronous function to handle the request. The function extracts the `title`, `description`, `dueDate`, and `priority` from the request body. It then validates the input to ensure a title is provided. If the validation passes, it creates a new todo using the `Todo` model's `create` method. If the todo is successfully created, it sends a response with a 201 status code and the new todo item. If there's an error, it sends a 500 status code with the error message.

### Reasoning:
I used a POST route because adding a new todo item is a create operation that typically uses the POST HTTP method. The route handler is asynchronous to allow for database operations that return promises. Input validation is crucial to ensure that the data being saved to the database is correct and to prevent errors. The status codes are standard for RESTful APIs: 201 for a resource that has been created successfully, 400 for a bad request when validation fails, and 500 for a server error. The `Todo` model is a placeholder for whatever ORM or database interface you're using, and it would need to be implemented separately.
