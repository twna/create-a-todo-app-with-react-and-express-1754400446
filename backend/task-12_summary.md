To create a route to handle deleting a todo, I'll assume we're working with a RESTful API using an Express.js server in Node.js. Below is the code for a DELETE route that will remove a todo item by its ID.


**Summary:**
The code above defines a DELETE route at the path `/todo/:id` using an Express.js router. It extracts the `id` from the request parameters, finds the index of the todo item with that ID in the `todos` array, and if found, removes it from the array. If the todo item is successfully deleted, it sends a 200 OK response with a success message. If the todo item is not found, it sends a 404 Not Found response with an error message.

**Reasoning:**
The approach taken is standard for RESTful APIs, where each resource (in this case, a todo item) can be accessed and manipulated using HTTP methods. The DELETE method is used to remove a resource identified by a unique ID. The code checks for the existence of the todo before attempting to delete it, providing appropriate responses for both success and failure cases. This ensures a clear and predictable API behavior.
