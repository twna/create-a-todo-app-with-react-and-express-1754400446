Certainly! Below is a simple React TodoList component that displays a list of todos. This component assumes that you pass a `todos` prop, which is an array of todo objects with `id` and `text` properties.


### Plain-text Summary:

The `TodoList` component is a functional React component that takes a single prop, `todos`, which is an array of todo items. Each todo item is an object with an `id` and `text` property. The component maps over the `todos` array and renders an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`) for each todo. The `key` prop for each list item is set to the `id` of the todo to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. The `PropTypes` are used to validate the `todos` prop to ensure it is an array of objects with the required shape.

### JSON Checklist:


### Reasoning:

The approach taken is to create a simple and reusable `TodoList` component that can be used in any React application. By using `PropTypes`, we ensure that the component is used correctly by developers, preventing bugs related to incorrect prop types. The `key` prop is essential for list rendering performance and for React to keep track of each element in the list. This component can be easily expanded or styled as needed.
