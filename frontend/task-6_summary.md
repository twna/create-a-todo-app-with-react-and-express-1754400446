To implement state management for a todo application, we'll use React with hooks like `useState` and `useReducer` for simplicity. If you're using a larger application, you might consider using a more robust state management library like Redux or Context API for more complex state logic.

Here's a simple example using `useReducer` to manage the todos:


**Summary:**
- We've defined an initial state for our todos.
- We've created a reducer function to handle different actions like adding, toggling, and deleting todos.
- We've used the `useReducer` hook to manage the state of our todo list.
- We've defined action types to avoid typos and make it clear what actions are available.
- We've created functions to dispatch actions to add, toggle, and delete todos.

**JSON Checklist:**

**Reasoning:**
- `useReducer` is used for managing more complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
- Action types are defined to ensure consistency and to prevent errors due to typos in action type strings.
- Dispatch functions (`addTodo`, `toggleTodo`, `deleteTodo`) encapsulate the logic for updating the state, making the component easier to maintain and reason about.
- The JSON checklist provides a clear overview of the state management features implemented in the todo application.
